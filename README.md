The Documentation-To-R (Doc-To-R) package uses locally run Large
Language Models to provide documentation on undocumented R code,
improving the readability of code written by others (or by you a long
time ago).

## Installation

You can install the development version of drllama from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("zanmat/drllama")
```

drllama requires having [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and
running.
